**Simple Storage HSK** *09-09-2021*
![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64644323/151061009-a288b03d-4d86-49d4-b06a-7e7293ca971b.png)

Adds over 70 of new storage options, all converted for HSK materials and research and neatly compacted into subcategories. Fully customizable stack size and storage filters via LWM's Deep Storage mod options if You feel like something is too strong/weak.

**Important: Due to Deep Storage and Architect Sense conflict, You have to disable "Put all storage units here" in LWM's Deep Storage mod options and restart the game, opening Deep Storage options will break it again putting things inside and outside subcategories until next restart.**

Safe to add mid-game, works both on 1.3 and 1.2.

```
v1.0
- HSK Material and Research conversion
- Added new research - Storage IV for the biggest of storage
- Added missing description to every storage that didn't have one 
- Added filters for what can be stored in every storage
- Heavily reduced stack amounts that can be stored, they still can hold a lot more than original HSK storage (for a price), but not so absurdly munch as in the original mod. This still can be modified in Deep Storage mod options as You wish
- Added or re-done masking for various things
- Added refrigerating ability to Medical Storage and Vending Machine, they now require power too and can breakdown
- Removed Industrial Shelf(Empty) and Industrial Dumpster(Empty) to not clutter storage tab even more with redundant things
- Removed Deep Storage dependency as it is integrated in Core SK
- Renamed some storage to better suit their new purpose and don't be confusing
v1.1
- Disabled Chemicals Storage, the medium one, as it caused a bug turning all outer basalt rocks into it when added to existing save.
- Open pallets - Pallet, Large Pallet and Large Pallet E can now store furniture too
- Wheelbarrow can now store chunks too, up to 8. This provides option for small stackable chunk storage before You can research and build Industrial Dumpsters
- Supply Crate (Parts) now stores electronics too
v1.2
- Added support for Architect Sense, compacted most of the things into subcategories, this greatly reduces amount of space they take on the screen with storage tab open
v1.3
- 3 new storage units, left unused in original mod - Office Shelf, Fridge and Metal Crate Large Pile
- Fixed issue with Medicine Storage and Vending Machines not reaching their targeted temperature
- Adjusted draw size of some things like Bundle Wrap to be bigger and fit better next to each other without leaving big gaps
- Other small graphical changes to make things look overall better
- Increased time storing takes for the massive industrial storage for balance reasons
v1.4
- Fixed research for the new research overhaul
- Fixed duplicate subcategories
- Re-balanced HP of some storage containers that needed it
- Nerfed OP Basket Pile, now stores 8 stacks instead of 15 in a single cell
v1.5
- Large Pallet E and D now cost and store same amount as its other variants
- New Supply Crate for stone chunks with 5 color variants, can store up to 20 chunks, early game alternative to wheelbarrow to stack chunks before You reasearch and afford industrial dumpster
- New industrial size refrigerator, Mega Fridge, stores up to 96 stacks of food and keeps them frozen
- Nerfed Fridge slightly, now stores 8 not 10 stacks
