**Simple Storage HSK**


![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64644323/151061009-a288b03d-4d86-49d4-b06a-7e7293ca971b.png)

Adds over 70 of new storage options, all converted for HSK materials and research and neatly compacted into subcategories. Fully customizable stack size and storage filters via LWM's Deep Storage mod options if You feel like something is too strong/weak.

Original Mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1961098970

**Important: Due to Deep Storage and Architect Sense conflict, You have to disable "Put all storage units here" in LWM's Deep Storage mod options and restart the game, opening Deep Storage options will break it again putting things inside and outside subcategories until next restart.**

Safe to add mid-game, works for 1.2-1.5.

```
- HSK Material and Research conversion
- Added new research - Storage IV for the biggest of storage
- Added missing description to every storage that didn't have one 
- Added filters for what can be stored in every storage
- Heavily reduced stack amounts that can be stored, they still can hold a lot more than original HSK storage (for a price), but not so absurdly munch as in the original mod. This still can be modified in Deep Storage mod options as You wish
- Added or re-done masking for various things
- Added refrigerating ability to Medical Storage and Vending Machine, they now require power too and can breakdown
- Removed Industrial Shelf(Empty) and Industrial Dumpster(Empty) to not clutter storage tab even more with redundant things
- Removed Deep Storage dependency as it is integrated in Core SK
- Renamed some storage to better suit their new purpose and don't be confusing
```
