Hate how your stockpile is overflowing of useless thing or just the fact it just a sore eye. I have a simply solutions by using my "Simply Storage"
a compact way to storage all of your useless Junk that you don't need into my Storage contains, no more of that over size stockpile take away space 
that you can use for more important things. Now you can have a compack base, Call 1-800-Simply-Storage.

Important: Due to Deep Storage and Architect Sense conflict, You have to disable "Put all storage units here" in LWM's Deep Storage mod options and restart the game, opening Deep Storage options will break it again putting things inside and outside subcategories until next restart.
